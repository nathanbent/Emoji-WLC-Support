# Emoji WLC Support - Overview
🤦🏽‍♂️

Emoji Support in WLCs can be an important consideration in choosing this crucial link between the WiFi users and the juicy WLAN they so require.  It shouldn't be, but it absolutely could be.

To that end, myself and some colleagues have endeavored to discover which brands and what lines support this dubious creation.

This list is ***not*** conclusive!

> We are exhausting the combinations we can try ourselves - if you wish to contribute to this project please consider the following:

- Pizza `🍕` is delicious, and is a wonderful option.
- Woman Astronaut `👩🏽‍🚀` is another wonderful option, though it is a longer character and may not always fit.
  - When sending astronauts, please provide a Rocket `🚀` on which they can travel.  This is just good form.
- 100! `💯`is a great positive message to send to nearby netizens who may be in need of inspiration.
